Visually impaired individuals face immense challenges in navigating safely, especially
when traditional white canes are the primary tool, as they only detect obstacles
through physical contact. While existing smart canes equipped with ultrasonic
sensors and buzzers offer some improvement, they are limited by blind spots,
particularly in the middle of the cane, and do not cater to deaf-blind individuals. This
project proposes a more comprehensive solution by developing an advanced smart
cane designed to not only alert users of nearby obstacles but also provide a vibration
motor for tactile feedback, making it accessible for both visually and deaf-blind users.
The ultrasonic sensors are set to detect obstacles within a 50 cm range, activating a
buzzer and vibration motor simultaneously to provide both auditory and tactile alerts.
The addition of a GPS module allows real-time location tracking, providing added
safety and peace of mind for the user's caregivers or family members. By strategically
placing the sensors along the entire length of the cane, including the middle portion,
this design eliminates the blind spots that are common in other smart canes. The
vibration motor is especially beneficial for individuals who are both blind and deaf, as
it allows them to detect obstacles through vibrations, which is critical for their safety
and mobility. This innovative approach combines sensor-based technology, real-time
location tracking, and multimodal feedback to create an affordable, practical solution
that significantly improves the independence and mobility of visually impaired
individuals, marking a meaningful advancement in assistive technology.
